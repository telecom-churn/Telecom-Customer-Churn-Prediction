# 📡 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## 🚀 Overview
Customer churn prediction is essential for telecom companies to retain customers and improve business performance. This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze telecom customer data and predict churn. By identifying customers at risk of leaving, telecom providers can take proactive steps to improve retention and reduce revenue loss.

## 📊 Dataset
We used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle containing 10,000 telecom customer records. The dataset includes demographic details, account information, and service usage metrics.

### 📌 Features
- **👤 Demographics**: Gender, Senior Citizen, Partner, Dependents
- **💳 Account Details**: Tenure, Contract Type, Payment Method, Monthly Charges, Total Charges
- **📡 Service Usage**: Internet Service, Streaming Services, Online Security, Tech Support
- **🎯 Target Variable**: Churn (Yes/No)

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
We implemented the following machine learning models:
- **📈 Logistic Regression**: A statistical approach for binary classification.
- **📏 Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Finds an optimal hyperplane for class separation.
- **🌳 Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy and reduces overfitting.
- **⚡ XGBoost**: A gradient boosting algorithm that sequentially improves predictions.

### 🏆 Model Selection & Evaluation
We performed hyperparameter tuning and 5-fold cross-validation to optimize performance. The models were evaluated using:
- **✅ Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness.
- **📊 Precision & Recall**: Trade-off between false positives and false negatives.
- **🔄 F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall.
- **📉 ROC-AUC**: Evaluates the model's classification ability.

## 📈 Results & Insights
- **🏅 XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy (~84%)**, outperforming other models.
- **🌲 Random Forest performed competitively**, showcasing the strength of ensemble methods.
- **📌 Contract Type, Monthly Charges, and Tenure were the most significant features** influencing churn.
- **📉 Customers with month-to-month contracts** were more likely to churn compared to those with longer-term contracts.

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage
